# disable_autologinoutlook
This is a small script written in batch, to be able to disable the auto login of Outlook or if you prefer any Microsoft account, when one logs into the web browser, our windows 10/11 automatically logs into our system, which is annoying because it happens to take our local account. So this script solves it by adding some keys to the windows registry and after restarting the computer we will no longer have that problem.
